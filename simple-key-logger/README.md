ABOUT MY CPP SOFTWARE
=====================

This software uses cpp-programming and made using ECLIPSE IDE, coming to software it is basically a key logger 
which runs in the background and logs all the keystokes into a file - [keylo55.txt] so, lets see how it works..

WORKING
=====================
- Deploy the gg.exe file into your target system and make it run all even during the boot
- all key stokes get logged defaultly into D:\keylo55.txt since i hope each of us have atleast 2 partitions

PROJECT	
=====================
- MY FIRST CPP SELF MADE project i learnt cpp and software making from online(youtube, udemy..)
- The total project, files, headers and debug software is above !
